<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi! My name is Katie. I have been in the medical field for over 10 years and currently work as a medical coder in Lenexa, KS. 
I have been learning about web development on my own, and will soon be a student at WGU in the Software Engineering program.
Thank you for visiting my website - I hope you enjoy some of the projects I have worked on. Stay tuned for more!
